# Ethereum Bootcamp Rust Edition

This repository holds the exercises' solutions for [Alchemy University Ethereum Bootcamp](https://university.alchemy.com/home).

The course exercises are written in javascript but I decided to redo them in Rust to learn the language.

## Folder Structure

The exercises are grouped by week and module under the `./src` folder. Modules' final projects are not in this reposiory.

- [x] [week-1: Bockchain Criptography](./src/week_1/)
- [x] [week-2: Blockchain Storage](./src/week_2/)
- [x] [week-3: Ethereum](./src/week_3/)
- [x] [week-4: Smart Contract Basics](./src/week_4/) (Includes final chapter challenges)
- [ ] week-5: Solidity (in progress)
- [ ] week-6: Solidity Core (not available yet)
- [ ] week-7: Solidity Next Level (not available yet)

## Future Plans

As I improve my knoledge of Rust, I plan to improve/update previous exercises.
